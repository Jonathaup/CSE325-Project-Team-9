# CSE325-Project-Team-9

Project: Recipe Manager.
Team: Four participants.

Overview: Help busy families and individuals organize their day better by planning out all of their meals ahead of time and keeping recipes, meals, and meal schedules all in one place. The recipe manager will also help users create a shopping list based on the recipes they have chosen for the week.  
Our app adds value by automating the recipe building, meal scheduling, and grocery list generating process. As soon as recipes are added to a user’s profile, they are available to be added to a meal schedule which will generate a shopping list.  
Scope:  
•	 User Authentication – Users will be able to sign up, log in, and log out securely. 
•	 Recipe Management (CRUD) – Users can create, edit, view, and delete recipes with fields such as title, ingredients, and steps. 
•	 Ingredient Management – Each recipe will allow multiple ingredients to be added, each with a name, quantity, and unit. 
•	 Shopping List Generator – The system will automatically create a shopping list that includes ingredients from selected recipes. 
•	 Responsive Design – The web app will be accessible and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices. 

App Features:  
•	 Users will be able to sign up, log in, and log out securely. 
•	 Users can create, edit, view, and delete recipes with fields such as title, ingredients, and steps. 
•	 Users can add multiple ingredients, each with a name, quantity, and unit. 
•	 Users can automatically create a shopping list that includes ingredients from selected recipes and edit or remove items from the shopping list manually. 
•	 Users can search ingredients in recipes 

 
Technical Considerations: 
•	 Data Storage: Recipes, ingredients, users, shopping list 
•	 User Accounts: Required to save Recipes, ingredients, and create shopping list. 
•	 External Services: We will rely on our own API for pulling recipes saved in the database. Depending on how that goes, we may employ external APIs for additional recipes. 
•	 Device Compatibility: Mobile and Desktop 


•	 Basic Security: Data validation and encryption for storing passwords and sensitive data
